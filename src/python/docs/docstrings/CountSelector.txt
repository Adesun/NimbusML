    Selects the features for which the count of non-default values is
    greater than or equal to a threshold.

    .. remarks::
        When using the count mode in feature selection transform, a feature
        is
        selected if the number of examples have at least the specified count
        examples of non-default values in the feature. The count mode feature
        selection transform is very useful when applied together with a
        categorical
        hash transform (see also, :py:class:`OneHotHashVectorizer
        <nimbusml.feature_extraction.categorical.OneHotHashVectorizer>` ). The
        count feature
        selection can remove those features generated by hash transform that
        have no
        data in the examples.

    :param count: The threshold for count based feature selection. A feature
        is
        selected if and only if at least ``count`` examples have non-default
        value in the feature. The default value is 1.

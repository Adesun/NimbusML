    Normalizes columns as specified below.

    .. remarks::
        In linear classification algorithms instances are viewed as vectors
        in
        multi-dimensional space. Since the range of values of raw data varies
        widely, some objective functions do not work properly without
        normalization. For example, if one of the features has a broad range
        of
        values, the distances between points is governed by this particular
        feature. Therefore, the range of all features should be normalized so
        that each feature contributes approximately proportionately to the
        final
        distance. This can provide significant speedup and accuracy benefits.
        In
        all the linear algorithms in nimbusml (:py:class:`Logistic Regression
        <nimbusml.linear_model.LogisticRegressionClassifier>`,
        :py:class:`Averaged Perceptron
        <nimbusml.linear_model.AveragedPerceptronBinaryClassifier>`, etc.),
        the default is to normalize features before training.

        ``Binner`` creates equi-density bins, and then normalizes every
        value in the bin to be divided by the total number of bins. The
        number of bins the normalizer uses can be defined by the user, and
        the
        default is 1000.

    :param columns: a dictionary of key-value pairs, where key is the output
        column name and value is the input column name.

        * Multiple key-value pairs are allowed.
        * Input column type: numeric or
         `Vector Type </nimbusml/concepts/types#vectortype-column>`_.
        * Output column type: numeric or
         `Vector Type </nimbusml/concepts/types#vectortype-column>`_.
        * If the output column names are same as the input column names, then
        simply specify ``columns`` as a list of strings.

        The << operator can be used to set this value (see
        `Column Operator </nimbusml/concepts/columns>`_)

        For example
         * Binner(columns={'out1':'input1', 'out2':'input2'})
         * Binner() << {'out1':'input1', 'out2':'input2'}

        For more details see `Columns </nimbusml/concepts/columns>`_.

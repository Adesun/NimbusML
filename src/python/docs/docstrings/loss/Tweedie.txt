"""
Some of the trainers accept a loss parameter that will be used for
training. It is also known as loss function, objective function, or
optimization score function.

.. remarks::
	Losses can be specified either as a string or a loss object. When
	loss is specified as one of these strings, the default values are
	used for the loss parameters. To change the default parameters, a
	loss object should be used, as seen in examples below.

	Each trainer supports only a subset of the losses mentioned above.
	To get the supported losses and the default loss, please refer to
	the documentation page for the specific trainer.

	The `Tweedie loss
	<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tweedie_distribution>`_ for
	regression. Assuming that the response variable y follows Tweedie
	distribution, maximum likelihood is used to estimate the parameters
	by maximuzing the probability of obtaining the observed data. Its
	string name is ``'tweedie'``.

	It can be used for :py:class:`OnlineGradientDescentRegressor
	<nimbusml.linear_model.OnlineGradientDescentRegressor>`.

:param index: Index parameter for the Tweedie distribution, in the
	range [1, 2]. 1 is Poisson loss, 2 is gamma loss, and intermediate
	values are compound Poisson loss.

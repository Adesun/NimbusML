"""
Some of the trainers accept a loss parameter that will be used for
training. It is also known as loss function, objective function, or
optimization score function.


.. remarks::
	Losses can be specified either as a string or a loss object. When
	loss is specified as one of these strings, the default values are
	used for the loss parameters. To change the default parameters, a
	loss object should be used, as seen in examples below.

	Each trainer supports only a subset of the losses mentioned above.
	To get the supported losses and the default loss, please refer to
	the documentation page for the specific trainer.
	The `Square loss
	<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-means_clustering>`_
	for regression.
	This loss calculates L2 loss, which is the square of the root mean
	square loss. Its string name is ``'squared'``.
	
	It can be used for :py:class:`FastLinearRegressor
	<nimbusml.linear_model.FastLinearRegressor>`,
	:py:class:`OnlineGradientDescentRegressor
	<nimbusml.linear_model.OnlineGradientDescentRegressor>`.

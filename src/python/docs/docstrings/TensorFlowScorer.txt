    Transforms the data using the 
    `TensorFlow
    <https://www.tensorflow.org/>`_ model.

    .. remarks::
       The TensorflowTransform extracts the specified outputs
       from the operations computed on the graph (given the
       input(s)) using a pre-trained
       `TensorFlow <https://www.tensorflow.org/>`_ model.
       The transform takes as input the Tensorflow model together
       with the names of the inputs to the model and names of
       the operations for which output values will be extracted
       from the model.
   
       This transform has the floowing assumptions regarding the
       input, output and processing of data:

        * The transform currently accepts the 
            `frozen TensorFlow model
            <https://www.tensorflow.org/mobile/prepare_models>`_
            as the input.
        * The name of input column(s) should match the name
            of input(s) in Tensorflow model.
        * The name of each output column should match one of the
            operations in the Tensorflow graph.

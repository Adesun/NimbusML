    Approximate bootstrap sampling using Poisson sampling.

    .. remarks::
        ``BootstrapSampler`` implements the `Poisson Sampling
        <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisson_sampling>`_ for generating
        samples with replacement for large datasets. The number of occurences
        for each observation in the new sample follows Binormial(n, 1/n),
        where n is the number of observations in the origin data and the
        number of target samples to generate.
        With large sample size, the distribution converges to a Poisson(1)
        distribution. Therefore, we generate
        the number of occurence for each observation independently using
        Poisson generation.

    :param complement: Whether this is the out-of-bag sample, that is, return
        all the rows that are not selected by the resampler.

    :param pool_size: This parameter is used in the shuffling process. A pool
        of a given number of rows will be constructed from the first
       rows in the input cursor, and then, successively, the output cursor
        will yield one
       of these rows and replace it with another row from the input. It is
        used in the shuffling process.

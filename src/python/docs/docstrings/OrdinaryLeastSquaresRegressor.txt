    Train an OLS regression model

    .. remarks::
        `Ordinary least squares (OLS)
        <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordinary_least_squares>`_ is a
        parameterized
        regression method. It assumes that the conditional mean of the
        dependent variable follows a linear function of
        the dependent variables. By minimizing the squares of the difference
        between observed values and the
        predictions, the parameters of the regressor can be estimated.

    :param normalize: Specifies the type of automatic normalization used:

        * ``"Auto"``: if normalization is needed, it is performed
          automatically. This is the default choice.
        * ``"No"``: no normalization is performed.
        * ``"Yes"``: normalization is performed.
        * ``"Warn"``: if normalization is needed, a warning
          message is displayed, but normalization is not performed.

        Normalization rescales disparate data ranges to a standard scale.
        Feature
        scaling insures the distances between data points are proportional
        and
        enables various optimization methods such as gradient descent to
        converge
        much faster. If normalization is performed, a ``MaxMin`` normalizer
        is
        used. It normalizes values in an interval [a, b] where ``-1 <= a <=
        0``
        and ``0 <= b <= 1`` and ``b - a = 1``. This normalizer preserves
        sparsity by mapping zero to zero.

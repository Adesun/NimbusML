    .. remarks::
        Trains a tree ensemble, or loads it from a file, then maps a numeric
        feature vector to three outputs:

        * A vector containing the individual tree outputs of the tree
          ensemble.
        * A vector indicating the leaves that the feature vector falls on in
          the tree ensemble.
        * A vector indicating the paths that the feature vector falls on in
          the
          tree ensemble. If a both a model file and a trainer are specified,
          will use the model file. If neither are specified, will train a
          default FastTree model. This can handle key labels by training a
          regression model towards their optionally permuted indices.

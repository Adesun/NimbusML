    The input to this transform is text. It applies a pretrained DSSM
    featurizer and outputs semantic embeddings for
    the input vectors and a cosine similarity computed between the query
    and document columns.

    .. remarks::
        DSSM is a neural network algorithm that produces feature embeddings
        for key-value string pairs. It is trained
        using a dataset consisting of positive key-value pairs, from which
        the original rows are used as correct
        examples, and the strings are recombined to produce adversarial,
        incorrect training examples. Some example of
        key-value pairs include search query and clicked document title text,
        search query and clicked ad content text,
        Search using Clickthrough Data <https://www.microsoft.com/en-
        us/research/project/dssm/#>`_ , an MSR publication.

    Scores natural language text and assesses 
    the probability the sentiments are positive.

    .. remarks::
        The ``Sentiment`` transform returns the probability that the
        sentiment of a natural text is positive.  The model
        was trained with the :py:class:`WordEmbedding
        <nimbusml.feature_extraction.text.WordEmbedding>` and
        :py:class:`NGramFeaturizer
        <nimbusml.feature_extraction.text.NGramFeaturizer>`
        on Twitter sentiment
        data, similarly to the sentiment analysis part of the `Text Analytics
        cognitive service <https://www.microsoft.com/cognitive-services/en-
        us/text-analytics-api>`_.
        The transform outputs a score between 0 and 1 as a sentiment
        prediction (where 0 is a negative sentiment and 1 is a positive
        sentiment). Currently it
        supports only English.
